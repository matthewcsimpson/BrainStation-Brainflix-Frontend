## BrainFlix - Full Stack Video Site - Front End

BrainFlix is a full-stack video player app modelled after Vimeo.  The back end is built with Node and Express. 

Completed as part of my studies at [BrainStation](https://brainstation.io).

The app is currently deployed here <http://brainflix-mcsimpson.herokuapp.com/>
