### BrainFlix - Full Stack Video Site

Completed during my time as a student at BrainStation, BrainFlix is a full-stack video player app modelled after Vimeo.  

The front end is created with React.js and uses React Router, Axios, DotEnv, as well as HTML, Sass/CSS3 with BEM.  The back end is created with Node.js, Express.js, and JSON files. 

A user can leave comments on the existing videos and simulate uploading a new video.  The site is designed responsively with breakpoints set for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewport sizes.
